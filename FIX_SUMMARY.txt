GITHUB ACTIONS TRAINING FIX - COMPLETE SUMMARY
================================================================================

PROBLEM:
--------
Training pipeline in GitHub Actions was not completing successfully due to:
1. MLflow connection failures when Databricks credentials unavailable
2. No fallback mechanism to local mode
3. Hardcoded Databricks dependency
4. Unused imports causing potential errors

SOLUTION:
---------
✅ Added intelligent MLflow tracking URI selection with automatic fallback
✅ Updated GitHub Actions workflow to support both local and Databricks modes
✅ Added Databricks credential validation
✅ Updated all modules (train, deploy, predict) for consistent fallback behavior
✅ Removed unused imports
✅ Improved error handling and logging

FILES CHANGED:
--------------
1. src/train_model.py
   - Added _validate_databricks_credentials() function
   - Added _get_mlflow_tracking_uri() function
   - Updated MLflow connection logic with fallback
   - Removed unused databricks.sql import
   - Fixed experiment name handling for SQLite

2. src/deploy_model.py
   - Added intelligent fallback logic for MLflow connection
   - Added Databricks credential validation

3. src/predict.py
   - Added intelligent fallback logic for MLflow connection
   - Added Databricks credential validation

4. .github/workflows/train-and-deploy.yml
   - Added credential checking step
   - Added conditional environment setup
   - Updated both train and deploy-production jobs

HOW IT WORKS NOW:
-----------------
1. GitHub Actions checks if Databricks credentials are available
2. If available: Uses Databricks mode (MLflow tracking on Databricks)
3. If not available: Uses local mode (SQLite MLflow tracking)
4. Training completes successfully in both cases
5. Model is registered in appropriate location (Databricks or SQLite)

BENEFITS:
---------
✅ Works out of the box without Databricks credentials
✅ Automatic fallback to local mode
✅ Flexible for both local and cloud environments
✅ CI/CD ready for GitHub Actions
✅ Better error messages and logging
✅ No breaking changes

VERIFICATION:
-------------
✅ Syntax check passed
✅ No linting errors
✅ Fallback logic implemented
✅ GitHub Actions workflow updated
✅ All modules updated consistently

STATUS:
-------
✅ FIXED AND READY FOR TESTING
